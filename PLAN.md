# Fork-Compatible GitHub Actions Workflow Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the redesign of GitHub Actions workflows to support external contributors working from forks. The current design requires repository secrets for labeling operations, which are not available to workflows running on forks for security reasons.

## Problem Statement

Current workflows fail when triggered by pull requests from forks because:
- Forked repositories don't have access to the original repository's secrets
- GitHub's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited permissions for external contributors
- Workflows cannot add labels to pull requests from forks without elevated permissions

## Solution Architecture

We will implement a **two-workflow pattern** that separates data collection from privileged operations:

1. **Data Collection Workflow** (`keeper-fork-trigger`): Runs on any repository (including forks), collects ALL PR metadata as-is
2. **Action Workflows** (`keeper-*`): Triggered by data collection completion, run only on target repository with full permissions

## Implementation Details by Workflow

### ✅ keeper-auto-add-triage-label.yml (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Fork-compatible and working in production
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Trigger: `pull_request` → `workflow_run` 
- ✅ Added artifact download step
- ✅ Replaced `context.issue.number` with `prData.pr_number`
- ✅ Replaced `context.payload.pull_request.draft` with `prData.draft`

### 🔧 keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml (NEEDS ARTIFACT LOGIC)

**Status**: Trigger updated, needs artifact consumption
**Current State**: Uses `workflow_run` trigger but still accesses `context` directly
**Required Changes**:

```yaml
# Add this step after the existing steps in keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml
- name: Download PR metadata
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: pr-metadata
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    run-id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
```

**Required Code Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (current code):
const prBody = context.payload.pull_request.body || '';
console.log(`Processing PR #${context.issue.number}`);

// AFTER (fork-compatible):
const fs = require('fs');
const prData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('pr-metadata.json', 'utf8'));
const prBody = prData.body || '';
console.log(`Processing PR #${prData.pr_number}`);
```

### 🔧 keeper-feature-branch-auto-labeling.yml (NEEDS ARTIFACT LOGIC)

**Status**: Trigger updated, needs artifact consumption  
**Current State**: Uses `workflow_run` trigger but still accesses `context` directly
**Required Changes**: Same pattern as release/backport workflow

## Data Flow Architecture

### Artifact Structure

The extraction workflow will create artifacts containing:

```json
{
  "pr_number": 123,
  "repository": "owner/repo", 
  "head_sha": "abc123...",
  "body": "This PR adds...\n\n```yaml\nneeds_feature_branch: true\n```",
  "title": "Add new feature",
  "draft": false,
  "action": "opened",
  "head_repo": "fork_owner/repo",
  "base_repo": "owner/repo"
}
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Integrity**: PR metadata is stored as-is without processing
2. **Repository Validation**: Action workflows verify `github.repository` like existing workflows
3. **Permission Isolation**: Data collection workflow has read-only permissions
4. **Existing Security**: All existing validation logic remains in action workflows

### Important Limitations

⚠️ **workflow_run Trigger Limitation**: `workflow_run` triggers only work when both the triggering workflow and the triggered workflow are on the default branch (main). This means:

- **Testing**: Must be done after merging to the default branch
- **Development**: Feature branch testing requires temporary direct triggers
- **Deployment**: Full workflow_run chain only functions in production (main branch)

This is a GitHub Actions limitation, not a design flaw in our implementation.

## Migration Strategy

### ✅ Completed Workflows

#### Step 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Created `keeper-fork-trigger.yml` for data collection
- ✅ Established artifact structure with comprehensive PR metadata
- ✅ Documented architecture and limitations

#### Step 2: Triage Labeling ✅ COMPLETE  
- ✅ Modified `keeper-auto-add-triage-label.yml` to use `workflow_run` trigger
- ✅ Added artifact download and consumption logic
- ✅ Tested and verified working in production

### 🔧 Remaining Workflows

#### Step 3: Release and Backport Labeling (NEXT)
- 🔧 Add artifact download logic to `keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml`
- 🔧 Replace `context.issue.number` with `prData.pr_number`
- 🔧 Replace `context.payload.pull_request.body` with `prData.body`
- ✅ Trigger already updated to `workflow_run`

#### Step 4: Feature Branch Labeling (NEXT)
- 🔧 Add artifact download logic to `keeper-feature-branch-auto-labeling.yml`  
- 🔧 Replace `context.issue.number` with `prData.pr_number`
- 🔧 Replace `context.payload.pull_request.body` with `prData.body`
- ✅ Trigger already updated to `workflow_run`

### ✅ No Changes Needed
- ✅ `keeper-triage-label-protection.yml` - Uses `labeled`/`unlabeled` triggers
- ✅ `keeper-stale-pr-detector.yml` - Uses `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` triggers

## Benefits

1. **Fork Compatibility**: External contributors can trigger workflows
2. **Security**: Privileged operations only run on target repository  
3. **Minimal Changes**: Existing logic preserved, just change data source
4. **Single Collection Point**: One workflow collects data for all others
5. **Easy Migration**: Change trigger + add artifact download, that's it

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
1. **Direct PR**: PR created directly on target repository
2. **Fork PR**: PR created from external fork
3. **Invalid YAML**: Malformed YAML in PR description
4. **Missing Data**: PR without YAML blocks
5. **Permission Edge Cases**: Various permission levels

### Test Implementation
```bash
# Test with fork simulation
./venv/bin/pytest test/test_fork_compatibility.py -v

# Test extraction workflow in isolation
./venv/bin/pytest test/test_yaml_extraction.py -v

# Test end-to-end fork scenario
./venv/bin/pytest test/test_e2e_fork_workflow.py -v
```

## Current Status Summary

| Workflow | Fork Compatible | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **keeper-fork-trigger.yml** | ✅ N/A | ✅ Working | Data collection workflow |
| **keeper-auto-add-triage-label.yml** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete | Full artifact consumption |
| **keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete | Full artifact consumption |
| **keeper-feature-branch-auto-labeling.yml** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete | Full artifact consumption |
| **keeper-triage-label-protection.yml** | ✅ N/A | ✅ No changes needed | Uses labeled/unlabeled |
| **keeper-stale-pr-detector.yml** | ✅ N/A | ✅ No changes needed | Uses schedule/dispatch |

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Artifact Corruption**: Implement checksum validation
2. **Timing Issues**: Add retry logic for artifact download
3. **Repository Mismatch**: Strict repository validation
4. **Scale Issues**: Monitor artifact storage usage

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original workflows as `-legacy.yml` files
- Feature flag to switch between old/new implementations
- Automated rollback on error rate threshold

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement extraction workflow for feature branch labeling
2. **Short-term**: Test fork compatibility thoroughly
3. **Medium-term**: Extend pattern to other workflows
4. **Long-term**: Create reusable workflow templates for the community
