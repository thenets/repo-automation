# GitHub Organization + Fork Testing Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

Based on the current README.md, there are significant limitations in testing GitHub Actions workflows with forks in organizational contexts:

### Current Limitations ✅ **RESOLVED**

1. **Permission Issues**: Traditional GitHub Actions workflows fail when triggered by pull requests from forks because:
   - Forked repositories don't have access to the original repository's secrets
   - GitHub's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited permissions for external contributors
   - Workflows cannot add labels to pull requests from forks without elevated permissions

2. **Testing Gaps**: Current test suite uses real GitHub API calls but doesn't properly simulate:
   - External contributor workflows (fork → organization repo)
   - Fine-grained token permission scenarios
   - Cross-repository workflow triggers (`workflow_run` events)
   - Organization-level permission inheritance

3. **Repository Context**: Workflows have hardcoded repository checks (`if: github.repository == 'thenets/repo-automations'`) that need organizational context testing
