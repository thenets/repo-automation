## Week 1 Foundation - Implementation Complete

- ✅ Created keeper-fork-trigger.yml workflow for data collection
- ✅ Implemented basic artifact structure for PR metadata  
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for artifact structure
- ✅ All workflows pass linting validation

### Next Steps
- Test fork trigger workflow with real PR
- Begin Week 2: Core Logic implementation


## Testing Fork Trigger Pattern ✅

Testing the complete workflow chain:
1. Fork trigger collects PR metadata
2. Triage workflow downloads artifact and applies label
## Testing Fork Trigger Pattern on Main Branch ✅

Now that we're on the main branch, the workflow_run triggers should work properly.
This change will trigger:
1. keeper-fork-trigger.yml (collects PR metadata)
2. keeper-auto-add-triage-label.yml (triggered by workflow_run)

Expected result: Triage label added via the complete fork-compatible workflow chain.
